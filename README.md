# JsonSubstitute
TFS/VSTS Build/Deploy utility task. 
Can be used to modify *.json configuration files during build or deployment.
This is an excerpt from the original Microsoft task [Azure App Service Deploy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/pipelines/tasks/transforms-variable-substitution?view=vsts).
The difference is that this implementation targets only a single .json file per execution.
For use cases and other examples please refer to the Microsoft documentation page mentioned above.
